Findings lekhda Hydro reference(2010):
One major technical barrier to fully harnessing Nepal’s hydroelectric potential is the country’s hydrology. The rugged and mountain alpine terrain endows Nepal with plentiful moving water, but the South-West monsoon delivering it is inconsistent. About 80 percent of the country’s rain occurs from June to September, the remaining 20 percent falls as snow during the dry season. This mismatch between when water is available and when it is needed year-round to generate hydroelectricity creates a complicated engineering challenge, leading severe load shedding particularly in winter, of up to 18 hours at times.
